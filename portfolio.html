Some popular on-demand rideshare apps, like Lyft and Uber, store and use data on riders, drivers, and trips, particularly data on when a trip happened, who was the driver, and who was the rider.The system will be able to aggregate drivers information and provide number of rides, ratings and cost across each drive.</p>

          <h3> Adagram Project</h3>
          <p>An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase. Adagrams is a fictional game in which a player is given a random set of letters and must make an anagram using those letters. Adagrams has a specific scoring system, so that the player's submitted anagram scores points. The rules for Adagrams are roughly inspired by the "Letter Round" portion of the British game show Countdown.</p>

          <h3> Hotel Project</h3>
          <p>The project was a contract to build a booking system for a small hotel. This system will be used by employees working at the front desk, and will not be available to the general public. This system will have two parts: a user interface that runs in the terminal, and a module full of business logic, classes and methods that keep track of which rooms are reserved when. my job was to implement the business logic only. You do not need to build a CLI for this project.</p>
