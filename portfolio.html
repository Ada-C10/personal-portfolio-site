                This project is to build a booking system for a small hotel. This system will have two parts: a user interface, and a module full of business logic, classes and methods that keep track of which rooms are reserved when. The code is to implement the business logic only.

                Rideshare Programs are systems that help people organize carpooling/vanpooling. The project is to read CSV files to get the data of drivers of a rideshare service and their ride history to see how many rides each driver has given and how much money a driver has made.
