            Godfather ipsum dolor sit amet. This one time, this one time I'll let you ask me about my affairs. Is that why you slapped my brother around in public? I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse. Never let anyone know what you are thinking. It's an old habit. I spent my whole life trying not to be careless. Women and children can afford to be careless, but not men.

          Chewie! Get behind me! Get behind me! Can't get out that way. Looks like you managed to cut off our only escape route. Maybe you'd like it back in your cell, Your Highness. See-Threepio! See-Threepio! Yes sir? We've been cut off! Are there any other ways out of the cell bay?...What was that? I didn't copy! I said, all systems have been alerted to your presence, sir. The main entrance seems to be the only way in or out, all other information on your level is restricted.

          Chew on cable scream for no reason at 4 am. Mrow. Hunt anything that moves leave fur on owners clothes chase dog then run away destroy the blinds but scratch hate dog. Purr as loud as possible, be the most annoying cat that you can, and, knock everything off the table sit in box. Meow to be let in. Chill on the couch table warm up laptop with butt lick butt fart rainbows until owner yells pee in litter box hiss at cats, love to play with owner's hair tie meow and walk away lick the curtain just to be annoying i like big cats and i can not lie pet my belly, you know you want to; seize the hand and shred it!. Suddenly go on wild-eyed crazy rampage mice scratch me there, elevator butt. Eat from dog's food cat is love, cat is life. Have a lot of grump in yourself because you can't forget to be grumpy and not be like king grumpy cat sleep on keyboard, and scratch.
