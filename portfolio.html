      <a href="https://github.com/katietj/oo-ride-share"> Object-Oriented Ride Share</a>
      <sub>
      This project incorporated pair-programming,
      multiple classes and csv-files, inheritance,
      and test-driven-development. It was a real
      challenge and in the end, I learned so much
      from it.

    <li class="solarsystem">
      <a href="https://github.com/katietj/Solar-System"> Solar System</a>
      <sub>
        I created a model of the solar system to practice working
        with classes for the first time. This project really
        helped me understand how classes can interact. There is a
        cool little command line interface too!

      <a href="https://github.com/katietj/ride-share"> Ride Share</a>
      <sub>
        My first foray into complex nested data structures!
        I took data of drivers from a rideshare service and
        calculated the number of rides a driver had given and
        how much money they made.

    <li class="randommenu">
      <a href="https://github.com/katietj/random-menu"> Random Menu</a>
      <sub>
      Random menu was my first Ada Academy project!
      A command-line interface that creates a random
      menu of food items based on arrays I created.
      </sub>
    </li>
    <li class="calculator">
      <a href="https://github.com/katietj/calculator"> Calculator</a>
      <sub>
        A calculator command line interface that allows
        a user to perform simple math. This project helped
        me get really comfortable with Ruby code that includes
        complex conditionals and loops.
