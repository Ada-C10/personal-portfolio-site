    <h1>Here are a few facts about myself:<h1>
    <p>- I live in Redmond, WA. But I grew up almost exactly halfway
      across the world in Bangalore, India.<br>
      - I love traveling. It's amazing to see that people in different parts of the
      world are different and yet so similar. Traveling makes me feel alive!<br>
      - Medicine was what I studied in my undergraduation. I have worked in ER and Pediatrics
      since then.<br>
      - Coding is a different experience compared to what I was doing, and I am enjoying it.
      It's fun to get the creative juices flowing!<br>
      - One of the things I like doing most, is trying out different forms of exercise.
      Sometimes it is too rigorous, but it's still fun trying things out.<br>
      - I have a bucket list of adventure sports I'd like to do.
      Sky-diving off a plane is at the top of the list!<br>
