          <p> ** Thanks for making it thru my game and/or looking thru all 14 pages in this file. If this page ever goes public i'm going to link this to a story I wrote about a year ago about shadowpeople. Its based off a selfie I took of myself at the Discovery Park lighthouse and a shadow that followed me home. The subreddit nosleep has some rules about links and stuff that I need to look into before I do, also my writting is terrible and I need to edit. The images and art in these files were taken from opengameart.org and kisspng.com. They were offered free to use by their creaters. Bad edits, git errors and terrible designs are my own. </p>
