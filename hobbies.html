        <p>
          My 2018 new year challenge was to learn how to bake. Started with French Macarons and taught myself many declicous pastries like cream puffs, cakes, fruit tarts etc.

      <p>
        One of my hobbies is to travel, though, I haven't traveled much lately. My fonts destination thus far has to be a tie between Cuba and south of Francd. I'm a sucker for blue ocean water, white sand and tropic weather. I have been to the Netherlands, France, England, Belgium, Cuba, Mexico, Canada, Ethiopia, UAE. I hope my next destination would be Greece and India.

      <img src="images/ddlj.jpg" alt="Photo of ddlj movie"/>
      <p>
        I am a big fun of Indian Cinema, or what is typically referred to as Bollywood. I hope to continue to pick up hindi and hope to at least have basic conversations during my visit. Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge or commonly known as DDLJ is one of my all time favorite Indian movie.
