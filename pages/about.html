          <h2>About</h2>

            <h3>Hi there.</h3>

            <p>I'm Lindsay, an aspiring developer, marketing dropout and collector of driver's licenses from all over the US. I'm originally from Chicago and I currently live in Washington with my partner, Doug, and our ferocious beast of a pup, Daphne.   </p>

            <p>I have spent the past year (inadvertently) knocking out some of life's most significant changes &#8212; a cross-country move, home purchase, marriage and a career change. While it was a tumultuous couple of months, I am thrilled that life has led me to the incredible city of Seattle. I am so proud to be a student at the Ada Developers Academy,  and I can't wait to transition into the world of software engineering.</p>
