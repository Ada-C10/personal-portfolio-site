          <h2>Creative Pursuits of the Non-Technical Variety</h2>

        <section class = "intro">
<p>My favorite hobby is trying to find a hobby. I get excited about trying something new and eventually tire of it, oftentimes before the project is even finished. This space is dedicated to documenting some of the latest undertakings.</p>

            <h3>The vintage chairs from hell.<h3>
            <h4>January 2018 - September 2018</h4>
            <div class = "image"><img src = "../images/chair2.jpg"></div>

            <p>I found a love for used furniture after facing reality that new stuff is expensive. So I was pretty psyched when I came across two cool chairs at a moving sale that only kind of smelled like a smoking parlor. We had the upholstery professionally done but attempted to refinish the wood ourselves. After taking the chairs apart, we attempted to strip the old finish anywhere from 3-6 times per piece. That process was followed by sanding, staining and coating. While we love the new additions to our home, I think I'd pay a professional next time.</p>

            <h3>Macram&eacute; and Mona.<h3>
            <h4>March 2017 - July 2017</h4>
            <div class = "image"><img src = "../images/macrame.jpg"></div>

            <p>I decided I really wanted a macram&eacute; backdrop for our Colorado farm wedding. I found Mona on Craigslist, an older woman who was really into macram&eacute; in the 70s. I bought over 50 yards of cord from her for $25. She regaled me with stories of her various creations including &#8212; but not limited to &#8212; plant holders, wall decor, and even a hanging bed. </p>
