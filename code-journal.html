      Welcome to my Code Journal or also known as my Code Blog. This is where I will post entries about what I have learned after each class. I have never been able to keep a journal, diary or blog for more than a couple days so this will be interesting!

        Today I slept in until the afternoon which was much needed. I cleaned and went to the Woodinville Home Goods to find a chair for my new vanity table. I know this isn't code journal related, but here's a post nonetheless.
