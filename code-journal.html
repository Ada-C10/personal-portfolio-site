              long week! phone + cards got stolen on the bus a week ago so i spent half our project time this week calling banks and updating budget spreadsheets. thursday morning my head fell down the your-future-is-hopeless spiral and now i don’t know how to reverse an array. an useless man is on the brink of having an important judge job for the rest of his life and he’s going to make lots of bad decisions. i’m like an entire wave and a half behind everyone else.
            </p>

            <p>
              and i dealt with all of these hurdles and stressors so well and i’m so proud for not being a total ass to myself about it! some notable accomplishments: 
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>was mostly proactive about emotional help. S was so nice and kind because duh, being nice and kind is good
              </li>
              <li>recognized my working habits: i’m efficient in mornings and evenings, afternoons are literally THE WORST time. nothing has changed since college. need to figure out how to structure my productivity around this 
              </li>
              <li>recognized that i spread stress and catch stress really easily so i’m going to push myself to work in spaces away from class where i feel calm when i need to, even if i feel social fomo (tip from K: convert fomo to jomo = joy of missing out)
              </li>
              <li>even when i’m a hag / stressed i still have perspective around being very privileged and Very supported and VERY loved. the night the man stole my phone and i lost my favorite earring, i went to bed. the next morning, i jogged 10 miles because i didn’t want to spend 2.75 but then i casually dropped $350 for an iphone?? huge huge privilege that i have well-functioning legs and emergency funds to pull this move. strangers + friends were so kind about this. people i love + look up to are so on board with me being here, learning how to code, even when i was/am silly and didn’t/don’t explain what it is i’m trying to out here.
              </li>
            </ul>

            <p>this gig involves so much more socializing than i had expected: pair programming, retros, slack, race caucuses, town halls, lunch with other people. i’m getting a better idea of how the tech ecosystem stays afloat–the interactions between the workers, the companies, the consumers. people love talking about users. people love not talking about profit. the whole male-dominated industry aspect is more... obvious and....annoying
            </p>
            <p>i knew who held power in academia, i knew how that power was shifting, i knew how i would water down and sell my identities to force universities’ doors and pockets to open up for me, i knew what work i would be expected to perform. i’m less familiar with how power and context affects me here. i’m an asian american woman. tech is mostly white and asian men. it feels like the most vocal inclusion & diversity folks in technical positions in silicon valley are asian american women. i appreciate them because they make MY life (as asian american cis woman) easier but i know better than to expect overachieving, straight, non-black, east asian american women to have a spectacular grasp in talking and advocating for environments that center blackness and queerness and disability. the intention isn’t to drag my (sigh) people. i’m just saying this is weird. they/we also shouldn’t be taking up all the space because folks should be able to advocate for themselves. idk!! power!! communication!! tech!!!

              <li>
                say yes, go to events, be generous, read the instructions, keep saying yes, read the instructions again, be so thrilled about being here that it’ll make you want to cry at 10pm on the bus
              </li>
              <li>
                going to tutoring sessions was...helpful? asking for help was...great?? wow didn’t expect this
              </li>
              <li>
                insecurities/fears: i’m a baby adult! i’m a disaster and forget my LAPTOP at home! my eyes and hands and back and body will be ruined!
              </li>
              <li>accomplishments/hopes: i learned five bash commands and now i’m a terminal queen! i don’t feel guilty about not programming or thinking about 24/7! on day one someone said i was funny
              </li>
              <li>ruby is much cuter than java. grateful that i got this chance and glad that i came back to coding despite having a very mediocre time trying to do this for a semester back when
              </li>
              <li>self-care checks: reading cookbooks and fiction, calling family, walking to piers, buying shoes / flowers / coffee, spending time with friends, recognizing joy
