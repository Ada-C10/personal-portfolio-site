      <h4> MY JOURNEY</h4>
      <article>
      <p>At 17, I left home to live in Vermont for a summer. I swam in many New England gorges, and wandered through thick deciduous forests. Raised a city girl, here I hopped barefoot, feeling the heat of the sun in each rock as I stepped from stone to stone. I felt the cool mountain water rushing over my toes. I experienced peace, found fulfillment in nature and saw the value of keeping our resources pristine. Unlike in the city, I scrunched my nose at each piece of trash I found on the trails, then bent down to pick them up and stick them in my backpack. I became a garbage collector, cleaning up strangers’ trash.
      </p>
      <p>
      As the days began to shorten, I returned to NYC. I became an advocate. I spoke to anyone who would listen, about what was then considered the “Global Warming Conspiracy.” I often found difficulty in convincing people to do anything or even believe it was something worth their attention, due to the “lack of evidence.” Hungry to arm myself with the necessary tools to inspire action, I applied to college as an environmental science major.
    </p>
    <p>
      I became a researcher, aiming to draw concrete relationships between our behavior as humans and the destruction we’ve brought to this earth. In college, to both my amazement and frustration, I discovered a whole realm of scientific literature and consensus on climate change. I read about scientific innovation and attended talks on how to combine research and policy to create long-term solutions for a more sustainable earth. In my senior year of college, I took a psychology class, realizing the solution to environmental degradation is more than a series of solar panel highways and soylent; rather, the solution is coordinated global behavioral change.
    </p>
    <p>
      The environment needs good design and even better storytelling. It needs people who are passionate about the planet, but just as passionate about its people. So I became a listener. I spent hours learning about people’s values, frustrations, and goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      My mother always taught me, “live your life as an example and if necessary, use words”. That’s the problem: the lack of digestible words coming out of the scientific community. I spent thousands of dollars and the better part of four years learning to read and digest peer reviewed literature. Yet, I am often left exhausted and at a loss of how to turn those words into actions. What the environment needs is better branding, to get people as interested in saving the planet as they are in purchasing the next iPhone.
<p>
</p>
      I’m a garbage collector, an advocate, a researcher, and a listener. I am whatever the environment needs, because I need the environment. For now, I’ll be a voice. My goal is to become a better writer and communicator so I can speak for the birds, the bees and most importantly our seas. Here you’ll find my quest toward sustainable, minimalist living, travel stories, and mostly a bookshelf for my overflowing fountain of random ideas and musings.
