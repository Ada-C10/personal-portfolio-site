          And that wraps up Unit-1 of Ada C10 Ruby adventures. I wonder if I'll miss Ruby.

          A pun for the retro board:

              It's been a "wheely" tough week.

              Read Cassandra Metz chapters 1-3 for context

          Ah, Ruby. I DO miss you. Clean, confident, eloquent,  scientific, well-grounded Ruby (Adies, this hopefully sounds familiar to you.)
        </p>
        <p>
          HTML and CSS seem hard. Not because it's a difficult language but because it definitely TRIGGERS the perfectionist in me. In many of my classmates, actually. Right now, CSS and I are NOT on good terms.
        </p>
        <p>
          I WILL CONQUER!

          Darn it. I'm starting to like CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's just so satisfying to watch the sad HTML website burst into beautiful color. Or at least, more beautiful than it would have been 5 days ago. You never know less than what you did before, right? I'm probably messing that quote up.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have been assigned a perfonal portfolio website(?) project for the weekend. I managed to stay awake on the bus ride home thinking of it (pie-like menu? I should upload the horrible sketch I made of it). The source of what you're reading now!
        </p>
        <p>
          Interesting quandary: should one sleep or should one dig deep into a google rabbit hole just to make the portfolio pretty.
        </p>
        <p>
          We shall see.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless, ACT-W is tomorrow. Must get croissants to kick off the day and then see what it's all about!
        </p>
        <p>
          And puns of the retro board:
          <ol>
            <li>
              HTML Form-al learning goals
            </li>
            <li>
              CSS: Why'd I use 'auto'? I must've been auto-of my mind!
            </li>
          </ol>
        </p>

      <section id="2018-09-16">
        <h4>2018-09-16: HTML/CSS: Perfectionism vs Sleep</h4>
        <p>
          Yea, that sleep thing? Not doing so good.
        </p>
        <p>
          BUT fear not, it wasn't due to Netflix binge-watching or novel-writing (I miss these more than Ruby, FYI), it was because my brain was lit on fire from ACT-W. Or at least, inspired in a cozy, warm way.
        </p>
        <p>
          Yesterday, I strolled into a talk from Alejandra Olvera-Novack about applying 5 Disney Animation Principles to CSS. Could you quiz me on these topics? Please don't. But could you spot one of them on the front-page? Maybe :)
        </p>
        <p>
          Though I can't take credit for it. That comes from a brilliant piece of code on JSFiddle. I find that moreso in HTML/CSS do I end up going on a Google Goose-chase (one for the retroboard?) to achieve some layout in mind.
        </p>
        <p>
          Note: Backup your photos long before you have some project where you'd want to use them. Or wait hours for it to be done.
