        <h3>First 6 weeks of Ada</h3>
        <section>
          <p>We have been dedicating our time to learning Ruby. Practicing the use of arrays, hashes, loops for in class projects. Also covered the use of csv files as a means to organize small amounts of data. Followed by object orientated programming, becoming very familiar with classes and inheritance. Lots of debugging by understanding a stack trace, minitesting, code coverage and facilitating the use of a GuardFile to automate testing files. Covering test driven development with a few projects where we were given testing requirements, and we had to create working code that would get the tests to pass. Working on a few pair projects and using Github as a way to collaborate. Learning and using the terminal to interact with our computers--it saves time. Learning Agile methodologies and best practices when designing a program. CS Fundamentals have touched on: converting binary to decimals and vice versa, sets, arrays, time complexity, space complexity, creating algorithms for common built-in methods such as count, sum, min, max, average, median, binary search.

        <h3>Week 7</h3>
        <section>
          <p>Learning HTML5 and CSS3. Focusing a lot of attention on Flexbox and CSS Grid to create site layout for static websites that can respond to various browser sizes. CS Fundamentals covering: stacks(LIFO), queues(FIFO), linked lists (single, double, circular), graphs (binary tree, binary search tree, binary heap), sorts (bubble, insertion, selection). We also had our first Meet & Greet for C10. Met representatives from many sponsoring companies.
