<article>New Yorker gone rogue – You can catch me turning in my nude pumps for a sturdy pair of hiking boots or find my toes buried deep in the sand, even on the coldest and rainiest of PNW days.

When I’m not outside, I spend my time in the kitchen, cooking up homemade treats (you can eat as much junk food as you want, as long as you make it), curled up with a book or plugged into rosetta stone desperately trying to become multilingual.
