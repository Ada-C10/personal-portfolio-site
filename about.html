    <div class="parg2">Currently, I am an Ada Developers Academy Student for C10 cohort and loving it. In the near future, I see myself working for a large tech company as a full stack developer. I want a career that is as challenging as it is exciting, but one that also makes life easier for people. Adding to the solid programming skills I will be gaining from Ada, I plan to keep the learning spirit and expand my knowledge with practical experience to develop a better understanding of all the layers of software development.
