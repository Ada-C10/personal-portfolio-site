      Hi everyone! My name is Layla and I'm a student at Ada Developers Academy.
      Ada Developers Academy is a year-long intensive school in software development for women and people of non-binary gender with no previous professional experience in computer programming. Before I was accepted into Ada, I worked at the University of Washington as a HRIS Analyst.
      <p>
      Outside of learning how to program, I enjoy travelling, attending concerts, playing video games and watching youtube videos on luxury, fashion and beauty.
      <p>
      I currently live in Redmond, Washington with my partner Greg and we have been residents of the Pacific North West for 5 years.
      <p>
      Thank you for stopping by!
