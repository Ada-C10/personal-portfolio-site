          Hi, I'm Danielle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Essentially: </strong> <br>
          Two years ago, I found a love mountain biking. I bought my first mountain bike  so I could join people on their mountain biking adventures. To this day I love how much I have to push myself and all the beautiful places I get to see. <br>
          I have also found a new love for metalworking outside of the work environment. Metalworking requires a lot of attention to detail which continually challenges me to develop my technique and change my approach to different pieces. <br>
          I'm a data lover and a computer nerd at heart. This past year I was accepted into Ada Developers Academy. I'm constantly amazed by the different things that can be accomplished through programming. See some of the projects I'm working on by checking out my portfolio tab!

          I am a young professional based in
          Seattle, WA with a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and a minor in Economics from the University of Colorado.  Currently, I am studying software development at Ada Developers Academy. Before Ada I was an Operations Support Manager at Zayo Group. I  worked with nationwide Outside Plant teams to  develop an excel tool to manage major construction milestones. With over 70 million feet of fiber build across the nation  my team and I were always looking for ways to drive production and optimize construction visibility in Salesforce.com.
