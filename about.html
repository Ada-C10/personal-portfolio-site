        <h2>My story</h2>
          <p>
            Alas time grows short and I should be in bed. But I have many lines of code to go before I sleep. Where did this all start?
          </p>
          <p>
            Could it have been during the long dark and cold winters in Alaska where I grew up? Venturing home after a long day at work only to have to sit in the car waiting for the moose to move away from my front door? Wondering if there was a warmer place to be?
          </p>
          <p>
            Or was it when we moved to Seattle in search of more sun (hah!) and less snow (usually) and more adventure? At least there was a thriving tech presence. As long as I'm here, I thought, I should dip my toe in the water.
          </p>
          <p>
            Which leads me to here, where I'm staying up much too late, tapping, tapping, tapping away on my keyboard. You're going out to a movie you say? Going out to dinner? Oh, I'd love to, but I'm chained to my computer, there is much more to do before the day is done. But there is light on the horizon. And soon, I will be on the other side of morning. I will climb to the top of this mountain, and on the other side I will see...another mountain. Sigh.
          </p>
          <p>
            Oh well. I think I've done enough for today. Tomorrow is another day.  I just need to keep reminding myself, this is fun. Really it is!
