        <h3><strong>Mechanical Engineer  |  Jeweler  |  Coder</strong></h3>
        <p>
          Hi, I'm Danielle.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong> Essentially: </strong> <br>
          This year I have found a love mountain biking. I was first introduced to it when I went all out and bought a Santa Cruz 5010 in the spring so I could join people on their mountain biking adventures. <br>
          I have found a new love for metalworking outside of the work environment. Metalworking requires a lot of attention to detail which continually challenges me to develop my technique and change my approach to different pieces.  I am still working with silver, brass and copper (see  a few of my personal projects to the right) I hope to start working with gold in the near future! <br>
          I'm a data lover and a computer nerd at heart. You can find me working on coding modules on Code Academy and reading Tech Crunch and Venture Beat to stay up to date on leading technology. I'm constantly amazed by the different things that can be accomplished through coding. I'm a Mechanical Engineer interested in optimization, control systems and feedback loops.   I am currently working on a new doggie door project, with remote access to an app on a phone.
