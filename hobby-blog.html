          <h3>Jim Lahey's No Knead Bread</h3>

        <section class="postbody">
          <p>If you haven't heard of No-Knead bread before, leave this page for a moment and
          do a quick Google search.  This recipe has been popping up all over food blogs ever
          since Mark Bittman popularized it the Cooking section of the New York Times. Bittman
          gives a written recipe, a video with Jim Lahey demonstrating the process, a revised
          recipe after several years of fine-tuning, and even a revised video with new techniques.</p>
          <p>The recipe I use is the most basic version and the only bread I've been able to bake
          successfully on multiple occasions.</p>
          <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
          <ul>
            <lh>Ingredients</lh>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp quick-rise yeast</li>
            <li>1.5 cups room-temperature water</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <lh>Equipment</lh>
            <li>large mixing bowl with a cover (I use a plate)</li>
            <li>mixing spoon (or just use your hands!)</li>
            <li>large cast-iron dutch oven (or any heavy pot with a lid that can withstand a temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <lh>Procedure</lh>
            <li>Mix all the ingredients together in a bowl.  This is called "No-Knead" for a reason, so
              don't worry too much about getting it uniform.  As long as you don't see any dry flour
              spots you're good to go.</li>
            <li>Cover the dough in the bowl and let it sit for 12-18 hours (Jim Lahey says closer to 18
              is better).  I suggest mixing it up before bed so that the dough will be ready for dinner
              the next day.</li>
            <li>About 2 hours before you want the bread to be ready, pour the dough out of the bowl onto a
              floured countertop.  Fold over the edges of the dough to form a neat little bundle.  Coat the
              inside of a large bowl with flour and put the dough bundle back in, seam side down.  Cover and
              let the dough rise for another hour.</li>
            <li>Put your heavy pot into the oven (with the lid) and preheat it to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
              The timing of this step depends on how long your oven takes to preheat.</li>
            <li>Open the oven, remove the pot lid, and pour the dough blob into the pot.  It should land
              seam side up.  If it doesn't land perfectly, don't stress about it too much.  You can shake
              the pot around a little to shape the bread, but we're going for rustic here anyway.</li>
            <li>Put the lid back on and bake for 30 minutes.  Keeping the lid on the pot traps in steam as
              the bread bakes, which helps the crust develop more... crustiness.  Professional bakeries
              use steam-injection ovens to achieve this effect.</li>
            <li>After 30 minutes, remove the lid and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the
              crust is a dark golden brown.</li>
            <li>Take the pot out of the oven and tip the bread out.  Let it cool on a rack for at least
              30 minutes.  As it cools, you'll hear lovely crackling noises!</li>
