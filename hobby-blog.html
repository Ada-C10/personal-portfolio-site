          <p>If you haven't heard of No-Knead bread before, leave this page for a moment and
          do a quick Google search.  This recipe has been popping up all over food blogs ever
          since Mark Bittman popularized it the Cooking section of the New York Times. Bittman
          gives a written recipe, a video with Jim Lahey demonstrating the process, a revised
          recipe after several years of fine-tuning, and even a revised video with new techniques.</p>
          <p>The recipe I use is the most basic version and the only bread I've been able to bake
          successfully on multiple occasions.</p>
          <p>Here's what you'll need:</p>
          <ul>
            <lh>Ingredients</lh>
            <li>3 cups all-purpose flour or bread flour</li>
            <li>1.5 tsp salt</li>
            <li>0.25 tsp quick-rise yeast</li>
            <li>1.5 cups room-temperature water</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <lh>Equipment</lh>
            <li>large mixing bowl with a cover (I use a plate)</li>
            <li>mixing spoon (or just use your hands!)</li>
            <li>large cast-iron dutch oven (or any heavy pot with a lid that can withstand a temperature of 450 degrees Fahrenheit)</li>
          </ul>
          <ol>
            <lh>Procedure</lh>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_2771.JPG" alt="lumpy-looking bread dough"/>Mix all the
              ingredients together in a bowl.  This is called "No-Knead" for a reason, so
              don't worry too much about getting it uniform.  As long as you don't see any dry flour
              spots you're good to go.  Cover the dough in the bowl and let it sit for 12-18 hours (Jim Lahey
              says closer to 18 is better).  I suggest mixing it up before bed so that the dough will be ready
              for dinner the next day.</li>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_6731.JPG" alt="risen dough with bubbles on the surface"/>
              When you check the dough 18 hours later, it should have bubbles on the surface.</li>
            <li><img class="sideways" src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_8041.JPG" alt="a shapeless blob of dough"/>
              About 2 hours before you want the bread to be ready, pour the dough out of the bowl onto a
              floured countertop.</li>
            <li><img class="sideways" src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_8840.JPG" alt="a folded ball of dough"/>
              Fold over the edges of the dough (4 corners) to form a neat little bundle.
              Coat the inside of a large bowl with flour and put the dough bundle back in, seam side down.
              Cover and let the dough rise for another hour.</li>
            <li><img class="sideways" src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_8528.JPG" alt="a cast iron pot in an oven"/>
              Put your heavy pot into the oven (with the lid) and preheat it to 450 degrees Fahrenheit.
              The timing of this step depends on how long your oven takes to preheat - just make sure the
              oven is ready by the time the dough will be ready.</li>
            <li><img class="sideways" src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_5858.JPG" alt="dough being poured from a bowl into a pot in the oven" />             Open the oven, remove the pot lid, and pour the dough blob into the pot.  It should land
              seam side up.  If it doesn't land perfectly, don't stress about it too much.  You can shake
              the pot around a little to shape the bread, but we're going for rustic here anyway.</li>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_6862.JPG" alt="pot with lid on in the oven"/>
              Put the lid on and bake for 30 minutes.  Keeping the lid on the pot traps in steam as
              the bread bakes, which helps the crust develop more... crustiness.  Professional bakeries
              use steam-injection ovens to achieve this effect.</li>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_4586.JPG" alt="partially baked bread"/>
              After 30 minutes, remove the lid and bake for an additional 15-20 minutes or until the
              crust is a dark golden brown.</li>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_3156.JPG" alt="fully baked bread" />
              Take the pot out of the oven and carefully tip the bread out.  </li>
            <li><img src="images/NoKneadBread/IMG_4962.JPG" alt="bread cooling on a wire rack" />
              Let it cool on a rack for at least 30 minutes.  As it cools, you'll hear lovely crackling noises!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>The best way to store this bread is in a paper grocery bag.  Enjoy!</p>
