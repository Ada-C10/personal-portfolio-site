        I'm just going to keep on typing and see what happpens. Over and Over.
        And over again. Here we go.

      <p>
        Okayyyyy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had all sorts of experiences. I have lived in Kenya opening a hummus business,
        backpacked in the appalachians in a wilderness therapy program working with adolescents overcoming drug addictions.
        I have also worked closely with local farmers as a produce manager at a local food coop.
