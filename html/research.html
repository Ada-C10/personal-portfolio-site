        <h2>Next Generation Sequencing</h2>
        <p class="Eichler">At the Eichler Lab, research focuses on understanding the impacts of structural changes in the human genome. Structural changes include segmental deletions, duplications, and insertions that could have occurred throughout the evolution of the human genome. By investigating this on a genomic level utilizing Next Generation Sequencing, our research worked to answer questions such as: How did the complex architecture of the human genome evolve? How do these structural changes contribute to disease and phenotypic variation within the human population? How does the human structure compare to that of great apes and other mammals?</p>
        <p>Next Generation Sequencing involves shearing DNA into many tiny pieces, sequencing each piece, and putting them together in order to create a longer and more accurate contiguous DNA sequence compared to traditional sequencing methods</p>

        <h2>Aging</h2>
        <p class="Eichler">At the Kaeberlein Lab, research focuses on understanding the mechanistic pathways of aging through various model organisms such as C. elegans, yeast, and mice. The prevalence of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer, Parkinson, and diabetes has increased over time, affects otherwise healthy individuals, and causes a rapid decrease in wellbeing during the last years of one’s life. By targeting the root of this problem—aging—in the lab, we will be able to eliminate many of these diseases as well as increase the healthy years an individual has during old age.

        <p>In order to exercise control over the speed and magnitude of aging in our model, we must better understand the mechanisms by which this occurs. Aging research in the past has established various methods to increase lifespan in C. elegans. Some of these methods include bacterial deprivation-- a simulated starvation environment, and hypoxia--a low oxygen environment. Though these conditions induce an increase in lifespan, the precise mechanisms by which they occur is not well understood. Our research focuses on unraveling the pathway by which a hypoxic environment increases lifespan</p>
