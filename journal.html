          <h1> My Journey</h1>
          <p>
            Before I joined Ada, I was an internal auditor in Costco. At that time, in order to collect audit evidence, I used SQL a lot. I need to build queries to extract data out of the ERP system. During that period, I noticed that writing codes is interesting. One of my friend was working in IT department, she knew a few Ada graduates and recommended Ada to me. That's my journey to here.
