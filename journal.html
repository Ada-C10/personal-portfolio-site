      <section>
        <h4>Ada</h4>
        <p>Life at Ada has been a rollercoaster - an array of emotions and pun-y jokes</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Movies</h4>
        <p>I rewatched Ratattouie the other day with a film club. It was surprisingly very good and I couldn't remember how I ever forgot it!</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Significant Other</h4>

      </section>
      <section>
        <h4>Family</h4>
        <p>It feels like everyone's hopes and dreams rest on me. I've never been good with that type of pressure. For now I'll just focus on MY hopes and MY dreams. Everyone elses seems much easier to manage than my own.</p>
