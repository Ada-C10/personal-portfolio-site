    <h1>Mystery Novels</h1>
    <p>My love for mystery novels began when I was in my early teens. After having read
      Enid Blyton novels for a few years, I had graduated on to start reading the cult classics,
      'The Famous Five'. And then my love affair with mystery began!
      Soon I was powering through the other series, that the author had written.</p>

    <p>Soon, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Alfred Hitchcock and Agatha Christie held me captive.
      These novels set in the early 1900s, had old world charm. Their popularity and quality were reflected in the fact that there were so
      many movie adaptations of the stories, that were as famous as the books themselves.</p>

    <p>Though I moved onto Steven King and Michael Crichton in my 20s, they never matched the calibre of the books that I had read in my teenage years.
      Dan Brown is another author whose books I like, however I do find that many contemporary mystery books tend to be
      long-winded.</p>
